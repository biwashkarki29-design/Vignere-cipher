- Generating key
- Encrypting the plaintext with the generated key
- Decrypting the ciphertext and recovering the original text
I created 3 different codes. : 
- keygen
- encrypt 
- decrypt 

Keygen:
Works by taking 3 input from the user. The input to run keygen file, plaintext file name and length of key to generate.
when the input is correct the code run other produces a error message and exits. Then the program checks the length of key entered by user.
If it is less than 0 then it produces another error message. if the input is positive number the code produces the key with the key length.

Encrypt:
Works by taking the input from user. Takes the name of the file which contains the key generated by Keygen and another file which is the plaintext file that contains a simple message. 
If user doesnt provide all this input the program generates a error message. If the input is correct then the code encrypts the plaintext msg with the generated key.

Decrypt:
This code works the same as Encrypt but just the opposite. It takes the ciphertext encrypted by previous code and decrypts with the key generated and prints the original msg.
